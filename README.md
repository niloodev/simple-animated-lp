## Proposal
- The application must include an animated mockup with animated icons, scroll-reactive animations, and shooting stars.
- It must have unit tests using Jest and Testing Library.
- Performance should remain smooth, even with running animations, with no FPS drops.
- It must use either Styled Components or Tailwind.
- SEO should be optimized with SSG, and the app should be hosted on Vercel.
- I followed the Atomic Design methodology to structure the project.
- Mobile-first methodology for responsivity.

## Tools

This application uses the following open-source packages:

##### Core ones.
- [Next](https://nextjs.org/) (Framework)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (Strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript)
- [Motion or Framer Motion]([https://www.typescriptlang.org/](https://motion.dev/)) (Animation library)

##### Stylization.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) (CSS in JS / TS styling)

##### Testing
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) (Javascript testing framework)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) (The name speaks for itself)

##### Code formatter, and other environment development tools.
- [ESLint](https://highlightjs.org/) (Javascript [linter](https://sourcelevel.io/blog/what-is-a-linter-and-why-your-team-should-use-it))
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) (Opinionated code formatter)
- [Figma Scheme](https://www.figma.com/design/Q7BQNcOvq2joGcxjJ8P61u/Technical-Assessment-%E2%80%93-Marketing-Contractor?node-id=35-10&t=yHbLyTdWC39CyVKM-0) (Application prototype)
- [Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) (Commit automation, runs unit tests before commiting)
